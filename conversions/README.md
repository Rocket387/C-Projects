string[] values = { "12.3", "45", "ABC", "11", "DEF" };
Create a looping structure that can be used to iterate through each string value in the array values.

Complete the required code, placing it within the array looping structure code block. It's necessary to implement the following business rules in your code logic:

Rule 1: If the value is alphabetical, concatenate it to form a message.

Rule 2: If the value is numeric, add it to the total.

Rule 3: The result should match the following output:

Output

Copy
Message: ABCDEF
Total: 68.3
