write code that validates integer input
Here are the conditions that your first coding project must implement:

Your solution must include either a do-while or while iteration.

Before the iteration block: your solution must use a Console.WriteLine() statement to prompt the user for an integer value between 5 and 10.

Inside the iteration block:

Your solution must use a Console.ReadLine() statement to obtain input from the user.
Your solution must ensure that the input is a valid representation of an integer.
If the integer value isn't between 5 and 10, your code must use a Console.WriteLine() statement to prompt the user for an integer value between 5 and 10.
Your solution must ensure that the integer value is between 5 and 10 before exiting the iteration.
Below (after) the iteration code block: your solution must use a Console.WriteLine() statement to inform the user that their input value has been accepted.

Ensure that you have an empty Program.cs file open in Visual Studio Code.

If necessary, open Visual Studio Code, and then complete the following steps to prepare a Program.cs file in the Editor:

On the File menu, select Open Folder.

Use the Open Folder dialog to navigate to, and then open, the CsharpProjects folder.

In the Visual Studio Code EXPLORER panel, select Program.cs.

On the Visual Studio Code Selection menu, select Select All, and then press the Delete key.

Write the code that implements each condition for code project 1.

Run your application and verify that your code validates user input based on the specified requirements.

For example, when you run your application, it should reject input values such as "two" and "2", but it should accept an input value of "7".
